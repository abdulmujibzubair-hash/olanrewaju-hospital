                <h1>Obstetrics & Gynaecology</h1>
                <p>We provide a comprehensive service that caters for women preconceptionally, during pregnancy and delivery as well as during the 6-week period following delivery. Our neonatal services are designed to provide easy access, comfort and convenience to the nursing mothers and their families during this vital period of their lives. We are a baby-friendly facility and we encourage breast-feeding in the first 6 months of life unless patient-specific circumstances preclude this most beneficial practice.</p>
                <p>All labour cases are assigned to a personal care midwife on admission to the delivery suite which is equipped with standard delivery beds, one of which is the ultra-modern Affinity 4 Birthing bed fitted with cardiotocograph for monitoring mothers and the unborn child. In addition, each midwife is provided with a pocket fetal Doppler for fetal cardiac monitoring. Newborns are promptly evaluated on delivery. Staff trained in neonatal resuscitation are always present if a need for such intervention arises. Basic resuscitation materials are also available.</p>
                <p>There is a neonatal unit equipped with an incubator and an ultramodern phototherapy unit. The Ultra BiliLight 220 device delivers up to 12 times more phototherapy treatments than any other device in the market. With the PEP bed Bililight phototherapy delivery system, exchange blood transfusions are almost never necessary, even for the most severely jaundiced neonates.</p>
